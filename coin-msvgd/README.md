# Coin MSVGD

## Description

This folder contains code for implementing Coin MSVGD.

## Requirements
The main software requirements are as follows.
```
python >= 3.8
R >= 4.0.4 
```

The following should also be installed, e.g., via `pip`.
```
rpy2 >= 3.4.4
tensorflow >= 2.4.0
tensorflow_probability >= 0.12
numpy >= 1.19.5
scipy >= 1.6.3
matplotlib >= 3.4.1
pandas >= 1.2.4
seaborn >= 0.11.1
scikit-learn >= 0.24.2
tqdm
absl-py
```

## Experiments
The results for Coin MSVGD, MSVGD, and SVMD in the paper can be 
reproduced as follows.

#### Simplex Targets

* The sparse Dirichlet posterior experiment is contained in [`dirichlet.py`](https://github.com/louissharrock/mirrored-coin-sampling/blob/main/coin-msvgd/dirichlet.py)
* The quadratic simplex experiment is contained in [`quadratic.py`](https://github.com/louissharrock/mirrored-coin-sampling/blob/main/coin-msvgd/quadratic.py)

#### Post-Selection Inference

* The 2D selection inference experiment is contained in [`selection_inference_2d.py`](https://github.com/louissharrock/mirrored-coin-sampling/blob/main/coin-msvgd/selection_inference_2d.py)
* The selection inference coverage experiments is contained in [`selection_inference_coverage.py`](https://github.com/louissharrock/mirrored-coin-sampling/blob/main/coin-msvgd/selection_inference_coverage.py)
* The selection inference HIV experiment is contained in [`selection_inference_hiv.py`](https://github.com/louissharrock/mirrored-coin-sampling/blob/main/coin-msvgd/selection_inference_hiv.py)
